        [part]
            story= _ "Scarrion didn't want to die, so he choked back his fear and hatred and agreed to work for Malevan. The necromancer brought Scarrion out of the cell and gave him his old equipment. 'You have a trial of sorts, young man. I need to see how my recent discovery interacts with the living. If you survive, I will permit you to be my assistant...'"

            story= _ "Scarrion fell three meters into sand, rolling as he hit the ground. When he recovered his stance, he saw that he was in a circular, high-celinged chamber with a mixture of sand and cave-floor. On the far end of the chamber was a shadowy figure."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Scarrion felt a great hatred emmanating from the shadow, and his disorientation cleared as he realized the shadow had to be destroyed if he was to live. He moved in to engage, and noticed through sideways glances that the chamber was littered with objects that might be of use..."
