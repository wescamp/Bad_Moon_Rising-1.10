            story= _ "The humans were defeated, and the demonic forces continued their fighting. The fortress, and the doomsday device it housed, lay dormant for centuries. That particular war was long, long ago, and none of those currently residing on Wesnoth knew anything about it. Some people in the north would soon learn of this past, however, as survivors from that unhappy era would be awakened to bring their hellish existence to the Great Continent."

            story= _ "It began with a decision by the powers in Weldyn to banish the night by creating a second sun. As wealthy as Weldyn was, such an endeavour would require a massive amount of resources. Expeditions were sent to scour the continent to recover any overlooked treasure without provoking the unnecessary expenses of war."

            story= _ "One such expedition into the frozen North discovered a cavern containing a palatial hall of polished marble and gold detailing. Upon further investigation, the explorers uncovered chambers full of exotic artifacts and metal objects of intricate design, like nothing any of the party had seen before. Though made of common bronze and steel, the objects would be of great interest to the dwarves, who would surely be willing to trade for specimens of such fine craftsmanship..."

            story= _ "But the North is a harsh place and the explorers were running low on provisions. The commanding officer, a Lieutenant Bersohn, decided it was best to keep the horses and veteran fighters healthy, to carry the loot and to fend off orcs, respectively. The recent recruits were but a drag on resources and not worth the upkeep. They would be left behind."
